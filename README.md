My name is Devin S.G. and I'm an entertainment focused front-end engineer that's discovering my next goal with helping build an interactive, entertainment platform. I've build front ends for journalists, musicians, gamers, engineers and producers for their own projects. Some of the projects I've made were built using:
<ul>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>React + React Native</li>
			<li>Vue</li>
			<li>Astro</li>
			<li>SASS</li>
			<li>three.js</li>
			<li>anime.js</li>
			<li>Adobe Experience Manager</li>
			<li>AWS S3</li>
			<li>and more...</li>
</ul>

You can find much, much more [in my porfolio.](https://devin.sg/)
